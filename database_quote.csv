As stated in Bhagavad Gita chapter 2, verse 45, ""The Vedas deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature, O Arjuna. Rise above the three modes, be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the self."" Empathy, on the other hand, requires an understanding of others' perspectives, emotions, and experiences. This can be accomplished through compassionate listening, putting oneself in another's shoes, and by recognizing the innate divinity in all beings. As stated in Bhagavad Gita chapter 6, verse 32, ""He who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, he never becomes lost to Me, nor do I ever become lost to him."" Thus, a deeper understanding of oneself and others can only be achieved through spiritual practices such as self-awareness and empathy, which are the very essence of the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita"
